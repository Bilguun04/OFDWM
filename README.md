## **AI in Project Development**  
We integrated AI tools like **ChatGPT** and **GitHub Copilot** throughout the development process. These tools assisted us in:
- **Syntax Checks & Code Generation**: Ensuring efficient, error-free code and generating sample snippets.
- **Testing & Debugging**: Creating test data and optimizing performance.
- **Learning & Best Practices**: Accelerating our understanding of new technologies and improving our coding standards.

By leveraging AI, we enhanced productivity, streamlined debugging, and adopted best coding practices more efficiently.
